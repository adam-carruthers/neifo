Open source code for a website to learn how to use numbers in a foreign language.

When learning a language, it is very difficult to get a grasp on numbers. If you learn from the words you hear, how many times are you going to hear numbers like 389 ("three hundred and eighty-nine", "trescientos ochenta y nueve") every day in normal conversation? It is harder to build up that natural link. The brain struggles even more when doing maths with those numbers.

This site aims to force you to grapple with numbers in the foreign language, to help your brain conquer them!
